# Tower of Hanoi Puzzle (WIP)
I am currently working on this project as part of my learning journey with Python and Algorithms that is based on FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Scientific Computing with Python curriculum. The code is being developed and will be pushed once the core logic is completed.

This repository will contain a Python implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The project focuses on solving the puzzle using `Recursive Algorithms` and managing the game state using Python's core data structures.
