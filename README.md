# Tower of Hanoi Puzzle (WIP)
I am currently working on this project as part of my learning journey with Python and Algorithms that is based on FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Scientific Computing with Python curriculum. The code is still in progress and will be edited a lot!

This repository will contain a Python implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The project focuses on solving the puzzle using `Recursive Algorithms` and managing the game state using Python's core data structures.

## Current Progress
* figuring `2**n-1` formula
* Made `move` func
* Learnt `modulo`
* Stacking the discs based on Hanoi rules

NOTE! <br>
I got school assignments with tight deadlines, this project will probably take longer than usual to complete, but I'll try my best to finish it as fast as I could.
